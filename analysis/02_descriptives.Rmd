# Descriptive Statistics

## 1. Sample Characteristics

Currently we do not have demographic information, thus the r chunk below does not run. Should any of this information be available in the future, the following entries should be removed from the r chunk below.

```{=latex}
\begin{verbatim}
 include = FALSE, eval = FALSE
\end{verbatim}
```


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Basic demographics

# Overall sample
nrow(df_wide)  # Total N
table(df_wide$gender)
mean(df_wide$age, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(df_wide$age, na.rm = TRUE)
range(df_wide$age, na.rm = TRUE)

# By school
df_wide |> 
  group_by(school) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# By experimental group
df_wide |> 
  group_by(group) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_female = sum(gender == "female", na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_female = mean(gender == "female", na.rm = TRUE) * 100
  )

```

## 2. Primary Outcome: Choice Behaviour

```{r}
# Overall choice rates
df_long  |> 
  summarise(
    mean_choice = mean(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_choice = sd(choice, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# By target type
df_long |> 
  group_by(target) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_choice = mean(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_choice = sd(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_trials = n()
  )

# By group and block (most important!)
df_long |> 
  group_by(group, block) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_choice = mean(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_choice = sd(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_trials = n()
  )

# By all three factors (for comprehensive table)
df_long |> 
  group_by(target, group, block) |> 
  summarise(
    M = mean(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = sd(choice, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  arrange(target, group, block)


```


## 3. Task Controls: Reward and Effort

```{r}

# Choice rates by reward level
df_long |> 
  group_by(reward) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_choice = mean(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_choice = sd(choice, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Choice rates by effort level
df_long |> 
  group_by(effort) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_choice = mean(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_choice = sd(choice, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Reward × Effort interaction pattern
df_long |> 
  group_by(reward, effort) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_choice = mean(choice, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_choice = sd(choice, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## 4. Moderator Variables

```{r}

sus_scores <- df_wide |> 
  select(starts_with("SUS_")) |>
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric))

sus_scores

str(sus_scores)

# Reliability
psych::alpha(sus_scores, use = "pairwise")$total# alpha
psych::omega(sus_scores, use = "pairwise")$omega.tot # omega total


# Total score 

SUS_total <- rowMeans(sus_scores, na.rm=TRUE)

describe(SUS_total) # descriptives for SUS

hist(SUS_total)


```

## 5. Ceiling Effects
